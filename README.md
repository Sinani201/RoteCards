# RoteCards
RoteCards is a simple browser-based flashcards program. It uses a technique called "spaced repetition"-- repeating learned items and reinforcing their meaning over time. It uses the same algorithm as the [Genius](http://genius.sourceforge.net/) app for Mac, which is no longer being developed.
