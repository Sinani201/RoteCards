# RoteCards
RoteCards is a simple browser-based flashcards program. It uses a technique called "spaced repetition"-- repeating learned items and reinforcing their meaning over time. It uses the same algorithm as the [Genius](http://genius.sourceforge.net/) app for Mac, which is no longer being developed.

## Try it!
RoteCards is written entirely in Javascript and runs in your browser! A live demo is hosted here on Github at https://sinani201.github.io/RoteCards/ .
