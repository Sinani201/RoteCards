RoteCards is a simple Javascript flashcards program. It uses a technique called "spaced repetition"-- repeating learned items and reinforcing their meaning in an efficient manner for memorizing. It uses the same spaced repetition technique as the [Genius](http://genius.sourceforge.net/) app for Mac, which is no longer in active development.

## Try it!
RoteCards is written entirely in Javascript and runs in your browser! A live demo will be hosted here on Github soon.
